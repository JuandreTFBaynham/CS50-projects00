<a name="codwarzone"><h3>Call of Duty Warzone is free but not issue free!</h3></a>
   <p> Veteran Twitch streamer Jaryd ‘summit1g’ Lazar has hit out at the developers of 
       Call of Duty: Warzone, demanding they listen to the community,
        as the game’s audio continues to cause frustration for players.<br><br>
        Despite being widely praised since its March 10 release, Warzone, CoD’s second attempt at the battle royale genre
        , has suffered a number of bugs and inconsistencies.<br><br>
        While this is all fairly routine for a new
         release of Warzone’s size, players are keen to see all issues ironed out by Infinity Ward. 
         The Modern Warfare developers were also responsible for
        Warzone, alongside support from Raven Software; the company who helped to perfect 2016’s 
        Modern Warfare Remastered.<br><br>
        One content creator who has taken particular issue with Warzone’s shortcomings
         is summit1g, the veteran streamer known for his versatility and the high level of gameplay he brings to
        all games he plays.<br><br>
        On March 25, the former semi-pro CS:GO player was playing some Warzone when he launched
         into a scathing rant about the game’s audio issues specifically.<br><br>
       “Counter-Strike’s f**king hide and seek mod takes more f**king skill than this whole goddamn game,” he said.
         “That’s a f**king hide and seek… sh*t! If I was gonna play hide and seek, I’d play that f**king game, man! Can
          I get some f**king footsteps, please?”
