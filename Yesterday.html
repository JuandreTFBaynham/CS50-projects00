  <h3>Google Stadia controller finally fixed!</h3>
  <p>A USB Type-C cable is no longer required to connect your Google Stadia Controller
       to your laptop or PC. Google has announced wireless controller functionality is 
       currently rolling out to Google Stadia users and will allow for cable-free connectivity
        between the Stadia Controller and browser-based Stadia devices.<br><br>

    Between its November launch date and now, the Stadia Controller supported wireless mode only
     on Chromecast Ultra devices. This left the browser-based version of Stadia in use across desktop
      and laptop PCs, and other compatible devices, with the choice of native inputs—such as a mouse,
       keyboard, or controller—or a wired Stadia Controller.<br><br>
    
    However, starting this week, it will be possible to connect your Stadia Controller to desktop and
     laptop devices without a USB Type-C cable.</p>
